# AI Podcast Generator

An application that leverages AI to generate engaging podcasts from user-provided topics and contexts. The system handles the entire process from content planning to audio generation, creating natural-sounding conversations between AI-generated participants.

## Goal of this app

My main goal was to create a **non-trivial application** that uses **enterprise-grade coding patterns** using a **100% Ai-driven coding** approach. The idea was to create an application that really does something useful, with coding standards and best practices that would be acceptable by a tech enterprise. It also includes some **typical enterprise-level requirements** like using an **external IDP (Identity Provider) and MFA.** 

I wanted to prove that Ai-driven coding can be used in an enterprise context, going far beyond the nice but way-too-simple demos that are circulating on youtube & co.

## Ai-driven coding setup 

The way I think about Ai-driven coding is that I work with a virtual team that consists of various Ai models and tools. I used the following setup for Ai-driven coding:

- **Perplexity** - my trusted academic researcher
- **o1 and Claud Sonnet** - my solution architects
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5 2024-10-22 via API** - my senior coder
- **Claude Haiku 3.5 2024-10-22 via API** - my tireless assistant that creates the diffs & merges all changes
- **[aider.chat](https://aider.chat)** - my coding buddy who ties everything together.  **Aider is an amazing coding agent that fits right into your SDLC.**  It ties together your prompts, model responses, codebase and IDE in a natural Ai-driven coding workflow.  **Highly recommended**.  Aider needs some instructions to prompt the models in the right way of course:
   - Coding best practices - see [CONVENTIONS.md](/CONVENTIONS.md).  Generated with o1 and manual edits.
   - Techstack definition - see [techstack.md](/documentation/techstack.md ).  Manual work.
   - Architecture guidelines - see [specification-architecture.md](/documentation/specification-architecture.md ).  Mix of gpt4o generated content and manual content.
   - Specification of user flow - see [specification-manual](/documentation/specification-manual.md).  Manual work.

I used **aider in architect mode**, which lets you validate the code produced by the Ai before adding it to the codebase. Recommended.

## Ai-driven coding experience

It's been an amazing experience.  **_Ai wrote >99% of the code in this repo!_**

My tasks:
* providing the spec
* orchestrating the implementation in phases (data model first, then services, then REST controllers etc)
* prompting in the right way
* checking the proposed solution and providing guidance
* testing the application
* pointing out bugs

It's clear: the Ai models still make a lot of (sometime foolish) mistakes.  But they can correct the bugs.  And in general they crank out high-quality code at a breath-taking speed.
**I was able to create this complete application in a couple of weekends of prompting, a fraction of the time it would have taken to code things manually.**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15 or higher
- Maven 3.8+

### Database Setup

```bash
# Login as postgres user
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE podcast_db;
CREATE USER podcastadmin WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE podcast_db TO podcastadmin;
```

### Zitadel Setup

This application uses Zitadel for OAuth2 authentication. Follow these steps to set up your Zitadel instance:

1. Create a Zitadel account at [console.zitadel.ch](https://console.zitadel.ch) or set up your own instance

2. Create a new Project in Zitadel
   - Go to Projects ‚Üí New
   - Give your project a name (e.g., "Podcast Generator")

3. Create an OAuth2 Application
   - In your project, go to Applications ‚Üí New
   - Choose "Web Application"
   - Set the following:
     - Name: Podcast Generator
     - RedirectURLs: 
       - `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/zitadel` (development)
       - `https://your-domain/login/oauth2/code/zitadel` (production)
     - Post Logout URLs:
       - `http://localhost:8080` (development)
       - `https://your-domain` (production)
     - Enable PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

4. Note down the following values for your `.env` file:
   - ZITADEL_DOMAIN (e.g., `my-instance.zitadel.cloud`)
   - ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID (from your application settings)
   - ZITADEL_ORG_ID (your organization ID)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```properties
PODCASTGEN_DB_HOST=localhost
PODCASTGEN_DB_PORT=5432
PODCASTGEN_DB_NAME=podcast_db
PODCASTGEN_DB_USERNAME=podcastadmin
PODCASTGEN_DB_PASSWORD=your_password

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key

ZITADEL_DOMAIN=your_zitadel_domain
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZITADEL_ORG_ID=your_org_id
```

### Building and Running

1. Build and run the backend:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

2. Install and run the frontend:
```bash
cd src/main/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
